# enemyGenetics
## Descrtiption
Computers solving problems by themselves is great. Wouldnt it be nicer if they would be able to challenge you as you interact more with the enviroment. Our implementation of a genetic algorithm for this competition allows designers, developers and creators to make choices about expected outcomes and allow the enemies statistics, attributes and behaviors to optimise adapt and overcome. Using the principles of simple evolutionary biology we combine, mutate and evaluate information of our enemies to be more efficient at their job. The attributes in this simple demo are health, speed and damage. 
* Health - size of body
* Damage - size of weapon
* Speed
each enemy has a fixed squared sum of these values, to have a stable enviroment and show that just by reevaluating the distribution of statisctics we can create a more challenging enviroment. The first scene provides a simulation of these principles: at the start you will see a random distribution of statistics that over a relativly short time start focusing on a single trait. 
## Future lookout
### ideas
The idea of such an algorithm can be used for any genre of game - regardless of it being a spaceshooter, a cozy exploration game or a massive strategy game - the game will feel more alive as a context usually defines goals that are either not executed, or take lots of time to get feeling exactly right. With this method more time can be spend on other parts of the experience and leave the optimisation to the system to explore solutions. Moreover this solution adapts to the player providing an extra layer of replayability.

### improvement areas
* The original random pool can have massive effects on the result - we are moving to a local minimum, and sometimes weird and inperfect results will arise. They will be unique but some safeguards would be recommended.
* It is not the most space or compute efficient algorithm, and giving it some pointers could help to get more consistent or faster results. These are disabled in this build of the game as it wants to focus on the pure beauty of nature and evolution.
